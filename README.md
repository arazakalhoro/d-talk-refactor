#### Code review of BookingController and BookingRepository
##### Positive Aspects
- The code is well-structured, with clear namespaces and class definitions.
- Both `BookingController` and `BookingRepository` extend their respective parent classes, which is a good practice.
- Each class uses doc blocks at a minimal level to identify a few required aspects.
- The code adheres to the 4-space indentation standard.
- Classes and functions follow standard naming conventions.

##### Areas for Improvement
- The code should adhere to the 120 characters per line rule for better readability and understanding.
- Add error handling and exception logging to improve robustness.
- Include comments and documentation to explain the purpose and functionality of each method and any complex logic 
  within the code.
- The code does not handle sensitive data such as user emails or passwords properly. Validation and preventative 
  measures should be implemented.
- Avoid using queries inside loops, as this can lead to performance issues. Instead, fetch all the required data in a 
  single query and then process it in the loop.
- The `getUserTagsStringFromArray` function in the `BookingRepository` class currently generates JSON by string 
  manipulation. It is recommended to collect data into an array and then convert it into JSON using the json_encode 
  function for better readability and maintainability.
  - he null coalescing operator should be used instead of if-else blocks in `BookingController`. The `distanceFeed`
    method contains many examples where this improvement can be applied.
- The methods in `BookingController` should return \Illuminate\Http\JsonResponse, ensuring that the functions are intended
  to return JSON responses.
- Some functions in `BookingController` contain conditions that are always true, i.e. `index` have 
  `if($user_id = $request->get('user_id'))` 
- `BookingController` and `BookingRepository` contain some unused variables.
- In `BookingController` and `BookingRepository`, consider using the `env` function with a default value or switching to
  the `config` function for better management of configuration settings.
